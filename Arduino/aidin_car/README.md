# Aidin's car
Aidin is my four-year-old son who loves to break things. I'm making a toy car for him to play with and perhaps break apart!  
Currently, it is only and Arduino Nano with a motor controller and an ultrasound sensor. I'll gradually add more to it. The chassis is made of plastic and plexiglass, mostly connected with screws and nuts. I'm not a big fan of glue.  
The car runs on a single 18650 battery that I salvaged from my broken laptop battery.

# Design
Will come soon ...
